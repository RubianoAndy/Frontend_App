        `We are committed to promoting sustainability through the development of solutions based on clean energy and
        the use of water resources. We offer consulting and services in the implementation of renewable
        energy technologies such as solar panels and wind energy systems, as well as water treatment plants
        without using chemicals. We also work on optimizing our clients' energy consumption through
        smart technologies that reduce environmental impact`,

    'what is the process for custom software development with your company': 'What is the process for custom software development with your company?',

    'faq_aswer_2':
        `The process for developing custom software with us begins with an initial consultation to understand your
        requirements and goals. We then create a detailed project plan and develop a prototype for your review.
        After fine-tuning the prototype based on your feedback, we proceed to full development and deployment.
        Finally, we offer ongoing support and maintenance to ensure the software continues to function optimally`,

    'what kind of support and maintenance do you offer for your technology solutions': 'What kind of support and maintenance do you offer for your technology solutions?',

    'faq_aswer_3':
        `We offer ongoing technical support and maintenance for all our technology solutions. This includes bug 
        fixing, software updating, and performance optimization. Our support team is available to resolve any issues 
        that may arise and to make adjustments based on your company's changing needs`,

        including data encryption, user authentication, and continuous threat monitoring. We conduct regular 
        security audits and follow industry best practices to protect our customers' sensitive information.`,
    
    'how do water treatment plants work': 'How do water treatment plants work?',

    'faq_aswer_5':
        `Our water treatment plants are designed to purify water using advanced electrolysis processes and
        redox reactions. Electrolysis allows contaminants to be broken down into harmless components without the
        need for added chemicals, while redox reactions remove impurities and heavy metals. This approach is
        not only effective, but is also safer and more sustainable for the environment.`,

    'what are the advantages of using electrolysis in water treatment compared to traditional methods': 'What are the advantages of using electrolysis in water treatment compared to traditional methods?',

    'faq_aswer_6':
        `The use of electrolysis in water treatment offers several advantages over traditional methods that use chemicals since it eliminates 
        the need to add chemicals to the process, which reduces waste and environmental impact. In addition, electrolysis is a highly efficient 
        and controllable method that can be adapted to different types of contaminants and specific treatment needs. This results in a safer, 
        more economical and environmentally friendly process for water purification`,

    'what are carnivorous plants and how do they obtain their nutrients': 'What are carnivorous plants and how do they obtain their nutrients?',

    'faq_aswer_7':
        `Carnivorous plants, or better known as insectivorous plants, are living beings that have developed the ability to obtain nutrients
        from the attraction, capture and digestion of insects and other small animals, especially in environments where the soil is poor
        in essential nutrients such as nitrogen. They use various strategies such as sticky traps, pitfall traps and suction traps,
        to capture their prey. Once trapped, the plants secrete digestive enzymes to break down the prey and absorb the necessary nutrients`,
    
    'how do carnivorous plants reproduce': 'How do carnivorous plants reproduce?',

    'faq_aswer_8':
        `Carnivorous plants reproduce both sexually and asexually. In sexual reproduction, they produce flowers that, after being pollinated,
        generate seeds that can be dispersed to germinate in new locations. In asexual reproduction, through shoots, suckers,
        stolons, buds or cuttings, creating clones of the mother plant. This method is common in environments where the conditions for seed germination
        are unfavorable`,

    'why are carnivorous plants important in ecosystems': 'Why are carnivorous plants important in ecosystems?',

    'faq_aswer_9':
        `Carnivorous plants play a crucial role in ecosystems, especially in areas where soils are poor in nutrients. They help
        control insect populations, acting as natural pest regulators, and contribute to biodiversity, since their presence
        promotes the coexistence of other species and maintains the ecological balance in the habitats where they are found`,

    'what types of environments can carnivorous plants be found in': 'What types of environments can carnivorous plants be found in?',

    'faq_aswer_10':
        `Carnivorous plants are usually found in environments with nutrient-poor soils such as swamps, peat bogs, and wet areas.
        These places usually have a high level of humidity and adequate sunlight, but the soil lacks nitrogen and other essential nutrients,
        which has caused them to evolve to survive by capturing insects and small animals to make up for the nutrient deficiency in the soil`,

    'what is the biggest threat to carnivorous plants today': 'What is the biggest threat to carnivorous plants today?',

    'faq_aswer_11':
        `The greatest threat to carnivorous plants is the destruction and alteration of their natural habitats due to urbanization, agriculture, 
        and climate change. Many species of carnivorous plants are endangered due to the loss of the specific ecosystems in which they thrive, 
        and overexploitation for the exotic plant trade also contributes to their decline. Protecting their habitats and regulating trade is 
        crucial to ensuring the conservation of these fascinating and ecologically important plants`,
